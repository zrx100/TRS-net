# TRS-net
We conbined Lasso regression and neural network  to achieve accurate and robust prediction based on intrinsic property of spectrum  under strong noise.
Two part is included in this program.

1.Lasso regression

2.Neural network

Need:

Python

Tensorflow 2.4.1

Keras 2.4.3

Matlab R2018a



Downloadables used in example

Dataset information: Bi-exponential - (tau1,tau2,A) Mono-exponential - (tau1)

Training data folder '/train'

Test data folder '/test'

Jupyter Notebook containing relevant script for data upload, network training and in silico testing.

This script is still under improvement
